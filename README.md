# AI-enhanced Home Design using Augmented Reality

## Project Overview

**AI-enhanced Home Design using Augmented Reality** is a project that leverages AR (Augmented Reality) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) to help users design and visualize their home interiors in an interactive and innovative way. The app offers various features, including real-time furniture placement, AR measurement tools, AI-based suggestions for interior designs, and more. Users can visualize, experiment, and make decisions on home decoration with the help of AI and AR technologies.

## Features

### 1. **Furniture Placement in AR View**
With this feature, users can place virtual furniture in their real-world environment using Augmented Reality. The following actions are available:

- **Move**: Drag furniture left, right, up, down, back, and forth.
- **Rotate**: Rotate furniture to adjust its orientation.
- **Resize**: Change the size of the furniture.
- **Replace Textures**: Change the texture of the selected furniture.
- **Real-Time Dimensions**: View the dimensions of the selected furniture on the screen.
- **Image Capture**: Capture images of the furniture in AR view.

### 3. **AR Measurement Tool**
This feature allows users to measure the length, height, and area of objects within the AR view. Users can use AR pins to measure the distance between points and get real-time measurements.

- **Length Measurement**: Measure the distance between two points.
- **Height Measurement**: Measure the height of objects.
- **Area Measurement**: Calculate the area of a selected space.

### 4. **Wall Color Change using AI**
Based on user-uploaded images or live camera feeds, the AI suggests color changes for the walls. The AI uses segmentation to identify different areas of the wall and applies the selected colors based on the user's preferences.

- **Upload Image**: Upload an image to change the wall color.
- **Camera Input**: Capture an image using the camera for real-time color change.

### 5. **Mood-Based Interior Design Change**
This feature uses AI to suggest design changes based on the user's mood. The AI analyses the uploaded image and suggests design changes that align with the desired mood or theme.

- **Upload Image**: Upload an image of the current room design.
- **Mood-Based Suggestions**: Receive suggestions for redesign based on the mood.

### 6. **AI-Based Suggestions for Room Design**
Users can upload an image of their room and specify the room type (e.g., living room, kitchen). The AI will then provide suggestions for furniture and layout based on the room category.

- **Room Category Selection**: Choose the room category (e.g., Living Room, Kitchen).
- **AI Suggestions**: Receive furniture and layout suggestions.
- **Generate Image**: Generate an image of the suggested design.

### 8. **Add to Cart, Add to Favorite, and Book Features in AR**
While using the AR features, users can add their favorite furniture to the cart, mark items as favorites, or even book them directly from the AR interface.

- **Add to Cart**: Add items to the cart for future purchase.
- **Add to Favorites**: Save items to the favorites list.
- **Book**: Book the items for purchase directly.
