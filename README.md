# ‚ú® AI-Enhanced Home Design with Augmented Reality (HDA) ‚ú®

**Visualize Your Dream Home, Instantly.**

HDA revolutionizes interior design by tackling common homeowner frustrations: visualizing changes, managing costs, and avoiding misaligned expectations. Our platform integrates cutting-edge **Augmented Reality (AR)** for real-time spatial visualization and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for personalized design recommendations, layout optimization, color selection, and cost insights.

**Problem:** Homeowners struggle to visualize how furniture, colors, and layouts will look in *their* actual space, leading to costly mistakes and dissatisfaction. Traditional design processes can be slow, expensive, and lack personalization.

**Solution:** HDA provides an intuitive mobile application (built with Flutter for cross-platform reach) allowing users to:
1.  **Scan** their physical room.
2.  Virtually **place and manipulate** furniture and decor in AR.
3.  Receive **AI-powered design suggestions** tailored to their style and space.
4.  Experiment with **wall colors** instantly.
5.  Get **real-time dimension** and product information.
6.  **Save, share, and even shop** for their favorite items.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (User Flow)

1.  **Scan Room:** User initiates AR mode and scans their physical space.
2.  **Browse & Select:** User explores the catalog and selects furniture/decor items.
3.  **Place & Arrange (AR):** User places items in AR, manipulating them (move, rotate, resize, change texture) until satisfied. Real-time dimensions are shown.
4.  **Measure (AR):** User optionally uses the AR tool to measure distances/areas.
5.  **AI Color Change:** User uploads/captures a room photo and applies virtual paint colors using AI segmentation.
6.  **AI Suggestions:** User uploads a room photo, selects type/mood, and receives AI text suggestions and/or generates concept images.
7.  **Save & Organize:** User saves favorite items, designs, and generated images.
8.  **Shop (Simulated):** User adds items to a cart or simulates booking.
9.  **Share:** User shares their creations via standard mobile sharing options.
